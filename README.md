#### node specific
- `Client(...).connect` method expects a `Socket` or any other `Duplex` as parameter.

#### browser specific
- `libquassel` is available as a global object.
- `Client(...).connect` method expects a `libquassel.WebSocketStream` or any other `Duplex` as parameter.

### Getting Started
#### node
```javascript
const { Client } = require('libquassel');
const net = require('net');

const socket = net.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 4242
});

const quassel = new Client((next) => next("user", "password"));

quassel.on('network.init', (networkId) => {
    network = quassel.networks.get(networkId);
    // ...
});

// ...

quassel.connect(socket);
```

#### browser
```html
<!-- In your HTML -->
<script src="/path/to/libquassel.js"></script>
```
```javascript
// libquassel in available as a global in browser
const socket = new libquassel.WebSocketStream('wss://domain.tld:12345', ['binary', 'base64']);
const quassel = new libquassel.Client((next) => next("user", "password"));

quassel.on('network.init', (networkId) => {
    network = quassel.networks.get(networkId);
    // ...
});

// ...

quassel.connect(socket);
```
